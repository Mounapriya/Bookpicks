This project is a web-based book recommendation system built using Python, Flask, and machine learning techniques. It allows users to enter a book title and receive a list of similar books based on content analysis.

## Features

*   **Book Search:** Users can search for books by title using an auto-complete search box.
*   **Recommendation Engine:** The system uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend similar books.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive web interface built with Flask and Bootstrap.
*   **Error Handling:** Provides informative error messages if a book is not found in the dataset.

## Usage

1.  Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
3.  Enter a book title in the search box and click "Get Recommendations".

## Technical Details

The recommendation engine works as follows:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:** The book data (title, author, publisher, language code) is combined into a single "tags" field.
2.  **TF-IDF Vectorization:** The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm is used to convert the text data into numerical vectors.
3.  **Cosine Similarity:** Cosine similarity is calculated between the vectors to determine the similarity between books.
4.  **Recommendations:** The top 5 most similar books are returned as recommendations.

## Data Source

The book data is sourced from the [Goodreads-Books dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks). This dataset contains information about books from Goodreads, including titles, authors, ISBNs, ratings, and other metadata.

## Future Enhancements

*   Improve the recommendation algorithm (e.g., using collaborative filtering or other advanced techniques).
*   Add user authentication and personalized recommendations.
*   Implement a more visually appealing user interface.
*   Expand the dataset to include more books or other book-related information (e.g., genres, reviews).
*   Implement fuzzy matching for book titles to handle typos and partial matches.
